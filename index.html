        Hi! Here's a little bit of information about myself: <br> <br>
        My name is Clarence Yeh. <br>
        I'm a Computer Science major in the School of Engineering.<br>
        My IP address is 130.64.158.81 <br>
        I grew up in North Andover, Massachusetts. <br>
        People probably wouldn't expect that I won "Mr. North Andover" playing a recorder <br>
